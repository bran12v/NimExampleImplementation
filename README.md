# Nim Example Implementation
Nim Implementation For Math 3134 Project

This Implementation is pulled from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/combinatorial-game-theory-set-2-game-nim/.
This repository serves as a simple way to access this reference and provides us with the solution to the Game of Nim.
We will be using this implementation as the solution to our problem: "How can we apply combinatorial game theory?" 
Through its application in this repository we are able to predict who will win a game of Nim reliably.

Conversion from C to Java was done by Brandon Vanek.
